## Economic Growth I

The following exercises are considered with the subject of economic growth. Basis for this is a real data set containing growth rates from 1960 through 1995 for 65 countries and various other variables that are possible determinants of growth. 

In particular, we are interested in the relationship between growth and trade. A detailed description of the dataset can be found <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">here</a>. 

The dataset `ecgrowth` is available in Your workspace.

*** =instructions

- Create a scatterplot of average annual growth (`growth`) on the average trade share (`tradeshare`).

*** =hint

Use the `plot` function.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# plot the data
```

*** =solution
```{r}
#plot the data
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
```

## Economic Growth II

We are interested in the relationship between growth and trade. A detailed description of the dataset can be found <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">here</a>. 

The dataset 'ecgrowth' is available in Your workspace.

Have a closer look at the scatterplot. Does there appear to be any relationship between the variables?


*** =instructions
- Yes, there seems to be positive correlation between `tradeshare` and `growth`
- No, one cannot see any relationship.
- I need to run a regression to answer this question.

*** =hint
Does one variable increase (decrease) if the other increases (decreases)?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')

The dataset `ecgrowth` is available in Your workspace.

Have a closer look at the scatterplot, again. There seems to be an outlier.

*** =instructions
- Can you identify the country associated with the observation in the scatterplot? Store its name in `outlier`.

Now assume that economic growth is determined as follows:

$$ Growth = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1 \times TradeShare + \epsilon$$

The datasets `ecgrowth` and `ecgrowth_new` are available in Your workspace.


*** =instructions

- For convinience, attach `ecgrowth`. Run a simple linear regression of `growth` on `tradeshare` using `lm()`. Store the result in `growth_reg`. Try to interpret Your findings.
- Use `growth_reg` with `predict()` to predict the growth rate for a country with a trade share of 0.5

*** =hint

You have to specify the argument `newdata`. This must be a `data.frame` object where each row is an observation of regressors you want to make a prediction for. Note that the column names must equal the regressor names. Here, we have a single regressor `tradeshare`. 

*** =pre_exercise_code

The datasets `ecgrowth` and `ecgrowth_new` are available in Your workspace.

The estimated regression equation from the last exercise is

$$ Growth = 0.6403 + 2.3064 \times TradeShare. $$ 

We continue with another regression.

*** =instructions

- Re-run the regression from the last exercise but this time without the outlier i.e. exclude Malta. Try to interpret your results
- Use Your results to predict the average growth of a country with a trade share of 0.5

*** =hint

You have to specify the argument `newdata`. This must be a `data.frame` object where each row is an observation of regressors you want to make a prediction for. Note that the column names must equal the regressor names. Here, we have a single regressor `tradeshare`.

## Economic Growth VII

Have a look at the estimated regression functions. Why is the regression function that was estimated using the dataset including Malta steeper than the regression function that excludes Malta?

Reconsider the previously conducted regressions. Estimated equations are:

<b> Full dataset </b>

<font color="blue"> $$ Growth = 0.6403 + 2.3064 \times TradeShare $$ </font> 

<b> Excluding the country Malta </b>

<font color="green"> $$ Growth = 0.9574 + 1.6809 \times TradeShare $$ </font> 

*** =instructions

- This is solely due to random errors which cannot be observed
- OLS is sensitive to outliers. Therefore, inclusion of Malta in the dataset causes the estimate of the coefficient of `TradeShare` to be larger than when Malta is excluded
- This cannot be answered without further information

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}

## Economic Growth VIII

In light of the last couple of exercises, we continue our analysis using the dataset `ecgrowth_new` which exlcudes Malta.

The regression model `growth_new_reg` is available in Your workspace. 
<br>
<br>
Can you reject the hypothesis $H\_0: \beta\_1 = 0$ vs. a two-sided alternative at the $95\%$ level?

*** =instructions

- Check whether $\beta\_1$ is significantly different from zero using `summary()`
- Assign the corresponding p-value to the variable `pval`
- Compute $95\%$ confidence intervalls for $\beta\_0$ and $\beta\_1$ using `confint()`

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}

## Economic Growth IX

Reconsider our regression approach:

$$ Growth = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1 \times TradeShare + \epsilon $$

It is not realstic that a country's trade share is the only factor driving its economic growth. It might be prefarable to employ a model with more regressors. In particular, we could consider the following additional variables:

- `YearsSchool`
- `Oil`
- `Rev_Coups`
- `Assassinations`
- `RGDP60`

Check the <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">description</a> for detailed info on variables. 

The dataset `ecgrowth_new` is available in Your workspace. 


*** =instructions

- Start by computing descriptive statistics for all columns of `ecgrowth_new` except `country`. Do so by subsetting the dataset accordingly and using relevant *implemented* R functions. Vectorize Your results. <b>Hint</b>: Use `apply()` on the columns of Your subsetted dataset. See `?apply`.   

*** =hint

- Column means of an array `a` can be computed by using `apply(a, 2, mean)`. `2` is the dimension of the array the function `mean` will be applied over
- Further useful functions are `min()`, `max()` and `sd()`


*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
ecgrowth_new <- ecgrowth[-65,]
```

*** =sample_code

*** =solution
```{r}
# Compute descriptive statistics
min <- apply(ecgrowth_new[,-1], 2, min)
max <- apply(ecgrowth_new[,-1], 2, max)
mean <- apply(ecgrowth_new[,-1], 2, mean)

## Economic Growth X

We will now consider the following multiple regression model:

$$ Growth = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1 \times TradeShare + \beta\_2 \times YearsSchool + \beta\_3 \times RevCoups \\\\ + \beta\_4 \times RGDP60 + \beta\_5 \times assasinations + \epsilon $$

*** =instructions

- Estimate the model using OLS. Store the result in `mult_mod`
- What is the value of the coefficient on $RevCoups$, a measure for political and social unrest? Try to interpret the coefficient. You will be asked about it in the next exercise 

*** =hint



*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')

## Economic Growth XI

The estimated regression equation for our extented model is

$$ Growth = 0.6269 -0.0005 \times TradeShare + 1.3408 \times YearsSchool -2.1504 \times RevCoups \\\\ -0.0005 \times RGDP60 + 0.3226 \times assasinations $$ 

How do You interpret the coefficient on $RevCoups$?

The model object `mult_mod` is available in Your workspace. 

*** =instructions

- If a country experiences *any* political insurrections, or similar, we expect economic growth to be *lowered* by $2.1504\%$, on average.
- A *one unit* increase (decrease) in numbers of political unrests is expected to decrease (increase) economic growth by $2.1504\%$.
- If a country experiences *at least one*  political insurrections, we expect economic growth to be *increased* by $2.1504\%$, on average.
- This coefficient on its own right cannot be interpreted directly.

## Economic Growth X.2

Let us stick with the multiple regression for a little longer. Say You would add $oil$ to the model i.e. the model became 

$$ Growth = \beta\_0 + \beta\_1 \times TradeShare + \beta\_2 \times YearsSchool + \beta\_3 \times RevCoups \\\\ + \beta\_4 \times RGDP60 + \beta\_5 \times assasinations + \beta\_6 \times oil + \epsilon $$

Could You estimate this model using OLS? <b>Hint</b>: You may want to try it out using a relevant function :)

The dataset `ecgrowth_new` is available in Your workspace. 

*** =instructions

- No, adding $oil$ as a regressor introduces perfect multicollinearity. This can be directly seen when inspecting the variable `oil`.
- Yes. Adding $oil$ as a regressor even reduces collinearity of regressors.
- Yes, because $Growth$ is a linear function of the model coefficients. This is always sufficient for OLS to be applicable.  
- This cannot be answered without jointly testing significance of the coefficients.

*** =hint

Use `lm()` to estimate the model above and interpret the outcome. Further it might be helpful to view the contents of the variable `oil`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
ecgrowth_new <- ecgrowth[-65,]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg_bad <- "That is not correct!"
msg_success <- "Right! `oil` is a zero vector. Together with observations for `intercept`, a vector of ones, we have perfect multicollinearity."

*** =instructions

- Join all descriptive statistics as shown above in an object of class `data.frame`. Assign the result to `descriptives`.
- Use the function `predict()` to predict the average anual growth rate for an *average* country, i.e. for an observation that has average values for all regressors.

*** =hint

- To join vectors `a`,`b` and `c` to a `data.frame` with named columns, execute `data.frame(a=a, b=b, c=c)`. See also `?data.frame`.
- In Your call of `predict()` You have to specify the argument `newdata`. This must be a `data.frame` object where each row is an observation of regressors you want to make a prediction for. Note that the column names must equal the regressor names. We have five regressors: `tradeshare`, `rgdp60`, `yearsschool`, `rev_coups` and `assasinations`.
