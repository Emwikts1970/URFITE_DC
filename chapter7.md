## Economic Growth I

The following exercises are considered with the subject of economical growth. Basis for this is a real data set containing growth rates from 1960 through 1995 for 65 countries and various other variables that are possible determinants of growth. 

In particular, we are interested in the relationship between growth and trade. A detailed description of the dataset can be found <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">here</a>. 

The dataset `ecgrowth` is available in Your workspace.

*** =instructions

- Create a scatterplot of average annual growth (`growth`) on the average trade share (`tradeshare`).

*** =hint

Use the `plot` function.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# plot the data
```

*** =solution
```{r}
#plot the data
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_function("plot", args = c("x","y"),
              not_called_msg = "You didn't call `plot()`!",
              incorrect_msg = "You did call `plot()` with wrong arguments, `x` and `y`!")

test_error()
success_msg("Well done!")
```

## Economic Growth II

We are interested in the relationship between growth and trade. A detailed description of the dataset can be found <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">here</a>. 

The dataset 'ecgrowth' is available in Your workspace.

Have a closer look at the scatterplot. Does there appear to be any relationship between the variables?


*** =instructions
- Yes, there seems to be positive correlation between `tradeshare` and `growth`
- No, one cannot see any relationship.
- I need to run a regression to answer this question.

*** =hint
Does one variable increase (decrease) if the other increases (decreases)?

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg_bad <- "That is not correct!"
msg_success <- "Exactly! There seems to be some positive relationship."
test_mc(correct = 1, feedback_msgs = c(msg_success, msg_bad, msg_bad))
```

## Economic Growth III

We are interested in the relationship between growth and trade. A detailed description of the dataset can be found <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">here</a>. 

The dataset `ecgrowth` is available in Your workspace.

Have a closer look at the scatterplot, again. There seems to be an outlier.

*** =instructions
- Can you identify the country associated with the observation in the scatterplot? Store its name in `outlier`.
- Remove the outlier from the dataset `ecgrowth`. Name the new dataset as `ecgrowth_new`.

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Identify the outlier. Assign the country's name to an object named outlier.
outlier <-

# Remove the outlier from the dataset.

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Identify the outlier. Assign the country's name to an object named outlier
id <- which.max(ecgrowth$tradeshare)
outlier <- ecgrowth$country_name[id]

# Remove the outlier from the dataset
ecgrowth_new <- ecgrowth[-id,]
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_predefined_objects("ecgrowth")
test_object("outlier")
test_object("ecgrowth_new")
```

## Economic Growth IV

We are interested in the relationship between growth and trade. A detailed description of the dataset can be found <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">here</a>. 

The datasets `ecgrowth` and `ecgrowth_new` are available in Your workspace.

*** =instructions

- For convinience, attach `ecgrowth`. Run a simple linear regression of `growth` on `tradeshare` using `lm()`. Store the result in `growth_reg`. Try to interpret Your findings.
- Use `growth_reg` with `predict()` to predict the growth rate for a country with a trade share of 0.5

*** =hint

You have to specify the argument `newdata`. This must be a `data.frame` object where each row is an observation of regressors you want to make a prediction for. Note that the column names must equal the regressor names. Here, we have a single regressor `tradeshare`. 

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
ecgrowth_new <- ecgrowth[-65,]
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Attach the dataset

# Run the regression

# Do the prediction

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Attach the dataset

attach(ecgrowth)

# Run the regression

growth_reg <- lm(growth ~ tradeshare)

# Do the prediction

predict(growth_reg, newdata = data.frame(tradeshare = 0.5))
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_function("attach")
test_object("growth_reg")
test_function("predict", args = "newdata")
```

## Economic Growth V

We are interested in the relationship between growth and trade. A detailed description of the dataset can be found <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">here</a>. 

The datasets `ecgrowth` and `ecgrowth_new` are available in Your workspace.

The estimated regression equation from the last exercise is

$$ Growth = 0.6403 + 2.3064 \times TradeShare. $$ 

We continue with another regression.

*** =instructions

- Re-run the regression from the last exercise but this time without the outlier i.e. exclude Malta. Try to interpret your results
- Use Your results to predict the average growth of a country with a trade share of 0.5

*** =hint

You have to specify the argument `newdata`. This must be a `data.frame` object where each row is an observation of regressors you want to make a prediction for. Note that the column names must equal the regressor names. Here, we have a single regressor `tradeshare`. 

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
ecgrowth_new <- ecgrowth[-65,]
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Re-run the regression
attach(ecgrowth_new)
growth_new_reg <-

# Do the prediction

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Re-run the regression
attach(ecgrowth_new)
growth_new_reg <- lm(growth ~ tradeshare)

# Do the prediction
predict(growth_new_reg, newdata = data.frame(tradeshare = 0.5))
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_function("attach")
test_object("growth_new_reg")
test_function("predict", args = "newdata")
success_msg("Good! Re-running the estimation tells us that the model based on the full dataset predicts higher values for `growth` for larger values of `tradeshare` than the model excluding Malta does.")
```

## Economic Growth VI

We are interested in the relationship between growth and trade. A detailed description of the dataset can be found <a href="http://wps.pearsoned.co.uk/wps/media/objects/12401/12699039/empirical/empex_tb/Growth_Description.pdf">here</a>. 

Model objects `growth_reg` and `growth_new_reg` are available in Your workspace.

Reconsider the previously conducted regressions. Estimated equations are:

<b> Full dataset </b>

$$ Growth = 0.6403 + 2.3064 \times TradeShare $$ 

<b> Excluding the country Malta </b>

$$ Growth = 0.9574 + 1.6809 \times TradeShare $$

*** =instructions

- Add both regression lines to the scatterplot

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
ecgrowth_new <- ecgrowth[-65,]
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
points(ecgrowth$tradeshare[65], ecgrowth$growth[65], col="red", pch=19)
text(ecgrowth$tradeshare[65], ecgrowth$growth[65]-0.5, "Malta")

attach(ecgrowth)
growth_reg <- lm(growth ~ tradeshare)
detach(ecgrowth)

attach(ecgrowth_new)
growth_new_reg <- lm(growth ~ tradeshare)
detach(ecgrowth_new)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
points(ecgrowth$tradeshare[65], ecgrowth$growth[65], col="red", pch=19)
text(ecgrowth$tradeshare[65], ecgrowth$growth[65]-0.5, "Malta")

# Add the regression lines to the plot
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Add the regression lines to the plot
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
points(ecgrowth$tradeshare[65], ecgrowth$growth[65], col="red", pch=19)

## Economic Growth VII

Have a look at the estimated regression functions. Why is the regression function that was estimated using the dataset including Malta steeper than the regression function that excludes Malta?

Reconsider the previously conducted regressions. Estimated equations are:

<b> Full dataset </b>

<font color="blue"> $$ Growth = 0.6403 + 2.3064 \times TradeShare $$ </font> 

<b> Excluding the country Malta </b>

<font color="green"> $$ Growth = 0.9574 + 1.6809 \times TradeShare $$ </font> 

*** =instructions

- This is solely due to random errors which cannot be observed
- OLS is sensitive to outliers. Therefore, inclusion of Malta in the dataset causes the estimate of the coefficient of `TradeShare` to be larger than when Malta is excluded
- This cannot be answered without further information

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(foreign)
ecgrowth <- read.dta('http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/Growth.dta')
ecgrowth_new <- ecgrowth[-65,]
plot(ecgrowth$tradeshare, ecgrowth$growth)
points(ecgrowth$tradeshare[65], ecgrowth$growth[65], col="red", pch=19)
text(ecgrowth$tradeshare[65], ecgrowth$growth[65]-0.5, "Malta")

attach(ecgrowth)
growth_reg <- lm(growth ~ tradeshare)
detach(ecgrowth)

attach(ecgrowth_new)
growth_new_reg <- lm(growth ~ tradeshare)
detach(ecgrowth_new)

abline(growth_reg, col="blue")
abline(growth_new_reg, col="green")
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg_bad <- "That is not correct!"
msg_success <- "Exactly! Inclusion of an outlier may considerably distort OLS parameter estimates. This means we should exclude such an observation."
test_mc(correct = 2, feedback_msgs = c(msg_bad, msg_success, msg_bad))
```
