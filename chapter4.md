## A Simulation Study I

Consider the regression model

$$ Y\_i=\beta + \epsilon\_i, $$

that is a regression of observations $i=1,\dots,n$ of some variable $Y$ solely on a constant or, put differently: the only regressor is a vector of ones

$$\mathbf{X} = (1 \dots 1)'.$$

In the plotting area on the right You see the result of a *Monte Carlo Simulation* that allows us to analyze distributional properties of $\widehat{\beta}$, the OLS estimator for $\beta$ in the model above and another linear estimator, $\overset{\sim}{\beta}$, which uses different weights than OLS. 

The sample data are drawn from a standard normal distribution, hence the true $\beta$ is zero. 

Is the result consistent with what You expect beeing aware of the Gauss-Markov Theorem?  

*** =instructions
- Yes, both estimators seem to be unbiased but the OLS estimator has less dispersion.
- No, the distribution of $\overset{\sim}{\beta}$ looks more like a standard normal distribution.
- Cannot be answered without prior inspection of the underlying data.
