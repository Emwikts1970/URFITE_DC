## Multiple Regression: Boston Housing Data

For the course of this section, we will use the `Boston` data set which contains 506 observations concerning housing values in suburbs of Boston. The data set comes with the package `MASS`.

*** =instructions

- Load the package and the data set
- Get youself an overview over the data set using the `summary` function. Hint: Use `?Boston` for detailed info on variables
- Estimate a simple linear regression model explaining *median house value*, `medv`. by the *percent of household with low socioecononomic status*, `lstat`, and a constant. 
- Inspect the model's summary

*** =hint

You only need basic functions here: `library()`, `data()`, `lm()` and `summary`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(MASS)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the package and the data set


# Get yourself an overview over the data set


# Estimte the model


# Call summary on Your model


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Load the package and the data set
library(MASS)
data("Boston")

# Get yourself an overview over the data set
summary(Boston)

# Estimate the model
lm(medv ~ lstat, data = Boston)

# Call summary on Your model
summary(lm(medv ~ lstat, data = Boston))
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_function("library")
test_function("data")
test_function("summary", index=1, args="object")


test_or({
  fun <- ex() %>% check_function('lm')
  fun %>% check_arg('formula') %>% check_equal()
  fun %>% check_arg('data') %>% check_equal()
}, {
  ex() %>% override_solution('lm(Boston$medv ~ Boston$lstat)') %>% check_function('lm') %>% check_arg('formula') %>% check_equal()
})

test_or({
    test_function("summary", args="object", index=2)
}, {
    ex() %>% override_solution("summary(lm(Boston$medv ~ Boston$lstat))") %>% check_function('summary') %>% check_arg('object') %>% check_equal()
})
```

## Multiple Regression: Boston Housing Data II

Now, let us expand the idea from the previous exercise by adding additional regressors to the model and estimate it again.

*** =instructions

- Regress the median housing value in a destrict, `medv`, on the average age of the buildings, `age`, the per capita crime rate, `crim`, the percentage of individuals with low socioeconomic status, `lstat`, and a constant. 
- Inspect the model summary
- The simple regression model's R^2 is stored in `R2_res`. Save the multiple regression model's $R^2$ to `R2_unres` and check whether the extended model yields a higher $R^2$. Hint: Use operators `<` or `>` for comparison.

*** =hint
You only need basic functions here: `library()`, `data()`, `lm()` and `summary`.
Use the help function to see how to specify additional regressors in the `formula` argument of `lm()`.

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Conduct the regression


# Inspect the model summary


# Compare the determination coefficients

```

***=pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(MASS)
R2_res <- summary(lm(medv ~ lstat, data = Boston))$r.squared
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Conduct the regression
mod <- lm(medv ~ lstat + age + crim, data = Boston)

# Inspect the model summary
summary(mod)

# Save the R^2 to R_unres. Compare the determination coefficients
R2_unres <- summary(mod)$r.squared
R2_unres > R2_res

```


*** =sct
```{r}

test_or({
  ex() %>% check_function('lm') %>% check_result()
}, {
  ex() %>% override_solution('lm(Boston$medv ~ Boston$lstat + Boston$crim + Boston$age)') %>% check_function('lm') %>% check_result()
})

test_or({
    test_function_result("summary")
}, {
    ex() %>% override_solution("summary(lm(Boston$medv ~ Boston$lstat + Boston$crim + Boston$age))") %>% check_function('summary') %>% check_arg('object') %>% check_equal()
})

test_object("R2_unres")
test_predefined_objects("R2_res")

test_or(
    test_student_typed("R2_unres > R2_res"),
    test_student_typed("R2_unres < R2_res")
)

```

## Multiple Regression: Boston Housing Data III

The multiple regression model from the previous exercise is available in your environment (`mod`). 

Use the summary function again and have a look at the coefficient section of the output printed to the console.

Do the signs of the coefficient estimates correspond with your expectations? 


*** =instructions

- No, the sign of age is implausible since old houses are always decripit such that their value decreases with their age.
- No, the intercept is just around $32.82 what is far to low for new build houses in districts with zero crime rate and only high-income people.
- One would expect a nonnegative intercept ($house \, value \geq 0$). House values should be lower in districts with high crime rates and a high percentage of low income individuals.
- It can hardly be said if the signs of the estimated coefficients are right as coefficients could be biased.

*** =hint

Think about the relations of housing values and used regressors. Use `?Boston` to check what exactly the variables measure.  

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
library(MASS)
data("Boston")
mod <- lm(medv ~ lstat + age + crim, data = Boston)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg_bad1 <- "No, not necessairily. Think about old mansions."
msg_bad2 <- "The intercept might not be that realistic but it certainly is not $32.82. See `?Boston`."
msg_bad3 <- "Bias might be a problem. But You were asked if your expectations are met by the result."
msg_success <- "Right, that sounds plausible. Good job!"
test_mc(correct = 3, feedback_msgs = c(msg_bad1, msg_bad2, msg_success, msg_bad3))
```
