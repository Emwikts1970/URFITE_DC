## Class Sizes and Test Scores

A researcher wants to analyse the relationship between class size and pupils' average test score. Therefore he measures both variables in 10 different classes and obtains the following results:

  <table>
      <tr>
        <td><b>Class Size</b></td>
        <td>23</td>
        <td>19</td>

        <td>375</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

- Create vectors, `cs` for class sizes and `ts` for test scores, containing the obeservations above.
- Draw a scatter plot of the results using `plot`.

## A Linear Relationship? 

Have a look at the scatter plot again (we made it a little bit more fancy here) and remember the result of the `cor()` function

```{r}
> cor(cs,ts)
[1] -0.9474424 
```
providing the empirical correlation coefficient of class size and test score.

Which of the following statements describes best the relationship between both variables?

*** =instructions

- The relationship is negative, linear and strong. There are no outliers.
- Both variables relate in a strongly nonlinear manner of unkown kind.
- The relationship is positive, linear and weak. There are outliers.
- It seems that $ClassSize = e^{TestScore}$.

## The Linear Model 

In this exercise, You will learn how to estimate a simple linear regression model.

In R, linear models can be fitted by use of the `lm` function. 

An argument to be always specified in `lm` is a regression formula of the form `y ~ x`. This expression states that You want to estimate a linear model of `y` as a function of `x`.  Type and execute `?lm` or `?formula` for further info on subjects.

*Data vectors from the previous exercise are available in Your workspace.*

*** =instructions
Estimate a linear regression of test score on class size using `lm`. Store the result in `mod`. Use the help function if you do not know how to start.



*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Estimate the regression model and store it in mod


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Estimate the regression model and store it in mod
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
```

*** =sct

              incorrect_msg = "You didn't call `lm()` with the correct argument, `formula`."),
  test_function("lm", eq_condition = "equivalent", not_called_msg = "You didn't call `lm()`!",
              incorrect_msg = "You didn't call `lm()` with the correct argument, `formula`.")

## The Linear Model - ctd.

Okay, now let's see how a model object is structured. 

*Data vectors and the model object `mod` from the previous exercise are available in Your workspace.*

*** =instructions
- `mod` is an object of type `list` with named entries. Check this using the function `is.list`.
- See what information You can obtain from `mod` using the `$` operator. Read out an arbitrary property of the object `mod`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Check that mod is an object of type list 


# Read out some arbitrary entry of mod e.g. fitted values:


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Check that mod is an object of type list 
is.list(mod)

# Read out some arbitrary entry of mod e.g. fitted values:
mod$fitted.values
```

## Summary and Model Objects

Consider again the relation of class size and test score. The model object `mod` from the previous exercise is available in Your workspace so You can use it for subsequent tasks. Convince Yourself by typing `summary(mod)` in to the console and get detailed information on the estimated model!

*** =instructions

- Obtain an overview over the model object `mod` using `summary()`
- Store the regression summary into `summary`. Discover what information you can extract from `summary` by use of the `$` operator

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Use summary() the get an overview over your model


# Store summary(mod) into summary


```

## Plotting the Regression Line

So far so good. Now, we would like to add a regression line to the scatter plot considered a few exercises before.

You are provided with the code for the scatter plot in Your script.

The object `mod` is available in Your working environment.

***=instructions
Add the regression line to the scatterplot. Hint: use `abline`. If you have no idea how to proceed, see `?abline`. `abline` will not work if you have not already executed the code to draw the scatterplot!

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Add the regression line the the scatterplot
plot(cs,ts)
```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Add the regression line the the scatterplot
plot(cs,ts)
abline(mod)
```

## Extract Components from a Model Object's Summary

Let us now read out and store some information of `summary`

The objects `mod` and `summary` are available in Your working environment.

*** =instructions

Suppose You are interested in how good the model fits the data. Create a new variable `R2` storing the regression's $R^2$.

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
summary <- summary(mod)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Store the regression's R^2 in R2


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Store the regression's R^2 in R2
R2 <- summary$r.squared
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_predefined_objects("summary")
test_object("R2")
```

--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp: skills: key:a775931dd8
## Coefficients

It might also be interesting to extract statistical information on the estimated coefficients of the model.

The objects `mod` and `summary` are available in Your working environment.

*** =instructions

You can extract a named $2\times4$ matrix with, amongst other things, estimated coefficients and standard errors from the `summary`. Save this matrix to an object named `coef`.

***=hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
summary <- summary(mod)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Save the coefficient matrix to coef


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Save the coefficient matrix to coef
coef <- summary$coefficients

## Dropping the Intercept

So far, You have conducted regressions where the model consisted of an intercept and another regressor. In this exercise you will learn ways to specify and to estimate regression models without the intercept.

Notice that excluding the intercept from Your regression model might be a dodgy practice in some models as You impose the mean of the dependend variable to be zero if all other regressors are also set zero.

*Vectors `cs` and `ts` as well as the list object `mod` from previous exercises are availabe in your working environment.*

*** =instructions

- Use the help function on `lm` (`?lm`) to find out how to specify a `formula` for a regression of `ts` solely on `cs`, i.e. a regression witouh intercept
- Estimate the regression model without intercept and store it in `mod_ni`

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
```

*** =hint

- In `lm()` use `ts ~ cs - 1` as the `formula` argument to estimate a regession model lacking an intercept

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Regress ts solely and cs, sore it to mod_ni


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Regress ts solely and cs, sore it to mod_ni
mod_ni <- lm(ts ~ cs - 1) # or: lm(ts ~ cs + 0)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_predefined_objects("mod")

test_correct(test_function("lm"),
    {
    test_student_typed("ts ~ cs + 0")
    }
)

test_function("lm")

test_object("mod_ni", eval=F)

## Regression Output: No Constant Case

You have estimated a model without intercept. The estimated regression eqation now is

$$ \widehat{score} = \underset{(1.36)}{12.65} \times size $$.

Convince yourself that everything is as stated above.

*Vectors `cs` and `ts` as well as the list objects `mod` and `mod_ni` from previous exercises are availabe in your working environment.*

*** =instructions

- Extract the coefficient matrix from the summary of `mod_ni` and store it in `coef`

*** =hint

Remember: List entries can be accessed with the `$` operator.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)

mod_ni <- lm(ts ~ cs - 1)
```

## Two Regression Lines, One Plot

The two estimated regression eqations are

$$ \widehat{score} = \underset{(1.36)}{12.65} \times size $$

and

$$ \widehat{score} = \underset{(23.9606)}{567.4272} \underset{(0.8536)}{-7.1501} \times size. $$

<br>

In this exercise, You have to represent the situation graphically. 

<br>

Hint: You are provided with the code line `plot(cs,ts)` which creates a scatter plot of `ts` and `cs`. It must be executed before calling `abline`! You may color the regression lines by using e.g. `col="red"` or `col="blue"` as an additional argument to `abline` to make them distinguishable.

<br>

*Vectors `cs` and `ts` as well as the list objects `mod` and `mod_ni` from previous exercises are availabe in your working environment.*

*** =instructions

Plot the regression lines for the regression models `mod` and `mod_ni`.

*** =hint

Use the `abline` function as before. See `?abline` for further help.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)

mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
mod_ni <- lm(ts ~ cs - 1)
```

## A Better Model?

Sometimes, graphical inspection can be very beneficial. Look at the plot from the previous exercise again and assume that You are looking at the population instead of a sample.

Which regression line does probably better in explaining the observed data?

*** =instructions

- The red one, i.e. the regression model lacking an intercept
- The blue one, i.e. the regression model including an intercept
- Both regression lines fit the data equivalently well
- This quation cannot be answered without futher information

*** =hint

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
mod_ni <- lm(ts ~ cs - 1)
plot(cs,ts)
abline(mod, col="blue")
abline(mod_ni, col="red")
```

*** =sct
```{r}
msg_bad <- "That is not correct!"
msg_success <- "Wow! You're doin' good! The fit of the blue regression line looks much better. Hence, excluding the intercept is not a good idea in this case."

```

--- type:MultipleChoiceExercise lang:r xp: skills: key:c0b8375eb8
## What Was R^2 Again?  

The coefficient of determination, denoted $R^2$, is a measure of a model's goodness of fit. It is defined as

$$ R^2 = \frac{ESS}{TSS} = 1 - \frac{SSR}{TSS}. $$

$TSS = \text{total sum of squares}$, $ESS = \text{explained sum of squares}$ and $TSS = \text{sum of squared residuals}$.

Which of the following statements about $R^2$ is right?

*** =instructions

- The coefficient of determination can only be computed for linear regression models.
- A model's $R^2$ shrinks if the absolute value of the residual sum decreases.
- The coefficient of determination is always defined on $[-1,1]$. 
- $R^2$ is a measure indicating the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s).


*** =sct
```{r}
msg_bad <- "That is not correct!"
msg_success <- "Wow!"
test_mc(correct = 4, feedback_msgs = c(msg_bad, msg_bad, msg_bad, msg_success))
```

--- type:NormalExercise lang:r xp: skills: key:673ab4d8fc
## TSS & SSR  

If graphical inspection does not help, one can resort to analytic technique in order to detect if a model fits the data at hand better than another.

We now go back to the simple model including an intercept. The estimated regression line for `mod` was

$$ \widehat{TestScore} = 567.43 - 7.15 \times ClassSize, \, R^2 = 0.8976, \, SER=15.19. $$

*You can check this as `mod` and vectores `cs` and `ts` are available in your working environment again.*

Now, please do the following:

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
```

*** =hint

The solutions can be found in several ways, e.g. using formulas and/or knowledge about the structure of `lm` objects. Don't forget about the `$` operator!
You may futher be interested in `?residuals` and `?var`.

*** =instructions
- Compute $SSR$, the sum of squared residuals, and save it to `ssr`
- Compute $TSS$, the total sum of squares, and save it to `tss`

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Compute the SSR and save it to ssr


# Compute the TSS and save it to tss


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Compute the SSR and save it to ssr
ssr <- sum(mod$residuals^2)

# Compute the TSS and save it to tss
tss <- 9*var(ts) # var() uses the unbiased sample variance! => Correct by multiplying with (n-1) = 9

## The R^2 of a Regression Model  

$$ \widehat{TestScore} = 567.43 - 7.15 \times ClassSize, \, R^2 = 0.8976, \, SER=15.19 $$

Now, use Your results from the previous exercise to compute $R^2$, the coefficient of determination.

*`mod`, `tss` and `ssr` are available in Your working environment.*

*** =instructions
- Use `ssr` and `tss` to compute $R^2$, the coefficient of determination. *Round* it to 4 decimal places. Save the result to `R2`.
- Use the logical expression `==` to check whether your result for $R^2$ equals the one mentioned above.

*** =hint

$R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSR}{TSS}$. You can round numerical expressions using the function `round`. See `?round`. 

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
mod <- lm(ts ~ cs)
ssr <- sum(mod$residuals^2)
tss <- 9*var(ts)
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Compute R^2, round it and save it to R2


# Check whether Your result is correct


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Compute R^2, round it by 4 decimal places and save it to R2
R2 <- round(1-ssr/tss,4)

# Check whether Your result is correct
R2 == 0.8976
```

## Recap: The p-Value 

What was the definition of the $p$-value again? 

Maybe the plot displayed on the right may help You remember. It depicts the case of a two-sided test where $|t|$ denotes the absolute value of the computed test statistic.

Choose the *right* statement.

*** =instructions

- The $p$-value is the proportion of cases for which we can reject the null hypothesis.
- The $p$-value is a measure for the probability that the null hypothesis is true.
- The $p$-value is defined as the probabilty of observing a result that is at least as extreme as the observed result, provided the null hypothesis is true. If the $p$-value is less or equals the choosen level of significance, the null is rejected.
- The $p$-value has to be choosen before conducting a significance test. If the $t$-statistic exceeds the $p$-value, the null hypothesis is not rejected.

## Inference Using p-Values

Suppose You are confronted with the following output providing the $t$-statistic for a test of the hypothesis $\beta_{cs} = 0$ and the corresponding $p$-value.

```{r}
Coefficients:
          t value   Pr(>|t|)    
cs        -1.1      0.27133
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
```

We choose the level of significance as $\alpha=0.05$.

Which of the following statements is *false*?

*** =instructions

- The coefficient of `cs` *is not* statistically significantly different from zero at any level of significance used in practice.
- We can reject the hypothsis at the $0.05$ level of significant since $p\text{-value} > 0.05$.
- The value of the t-statistic is not an element of the set of values for which the null would be rejected.
- Given the info above it is not possible to say whether the null is rejected or not.

*** =sct
```{r}
msg_bad <- "No, that is not correct!"
msg_success <- "Exactly!"

## Testing Two Null Hypotheses Individually

Now consider again the estimated regression line

$$ \widehat{TestScore} = \underset{(23.9606)}{567.43} - \underset{(0.8536)}{7.15} \times cs, \, R^2 = 0.8976, \, SER=15.19 $$

with standard errors in parentheses.

*** =instructions

- Compute the $p$-value for a test of the hypothesis that the intercept is zero. Save the result to `p_int`
- Compute the $p$-value for a test of the hypothesis that the coefficient of $cs$ is zero. Save the result to `p_cs`
<br>
Think about the inference drawn from these results. Can You reject the null hypotheses? You will be asked about this in the next exercise.

***=hint

Both hypotheses can be tested using a two-sided test. Remember the forumla for the $p$-vaule in this situation.
Use `pnorm` to obtain cumulated probabilities for standard normal distributed outcomes.

## Regression when X is a Dummy Variable I

Instead of using the regressor $CS$, we might be interested in running a regression where the regressor, $D$ say, is binary variable or so-called dummy variable. 

For example, we may define $D_i$ in the following way:

$$ D_i = \begin{cases} 1 \ \ \text{if $CS$ in the $i^{th}$ class < 26} \\\\ 0 \ \ \text{if $CS$ in the $i^{th}$ class $\geq$ 26} \end{cases} $$

Using R, one way to do this is as follows:

```{r}
# Define an empty vector D
D <- c()
# Assign values accordingly using a loop
for (i in 1:length(cs)) {
  if (cs[i] < ???) { 
    D[i] <- ???
    } else {
      D[i] <- 0
    }
  }
```

Notice that the code above contains two gaps indicated by `???`. Can you replace them with the right expressions?

<br>
*Vectors `cs` and `ts` are availabe in your working environment.*
<br>

***=instructions

- Replace the `???` and create the dummy regressor `D` using the proposed loop above.
- Convince Yourself that `D` is a vector. Check its length.
- Estimate a regression of $cs$ on $D$.
- Call summary on Your model. Think about how the estimated coefficients are interpreted!

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cs <- c(23, 19, 30, 22, 23, 29, 35, 36, 33, 25)
ts <- c(430, 430, 333, 410, 390, 377, 325, 310, 328, 375)
```

***=hint
- Check if an object is a vector using the function `is.vector()`
- An object's length can be checked with `length`

***=sample_code
```{r}
# Create D


# Convince yourself that D is a vector. Check its length.


# Regress ts on D and constant


# Inspect the your model using summary
```

***=solution
```{r}
## Create D
# Define an empty vector D
D <- c()
# Assign values accordingly using the loop
for (i in 1:length(cs)) {
  if (cs[i] < 26) { 
    D[i] <- 1
    } else {
      D[i] <- 0
    }
  }

# Convince yourself that D is a vector and Check its length
is.vector(D)
length(D)

# Regress ts on D and constant
mod <- lm(ts ~ D)

# Call summary on the model object
summary(mod)
```

<br>
Which of the following statements is *wrong*?

*** =instructions

- The intercept can be interpreted as the estimated average test scrore among classes with at least 26 pupils. 
- Increasing the class size by one unit leads to an estimated increase of 72.40 in test score on average.
- The estimated average test score in classes with less than 26 pupils is 407.
- The regression equation indicates that test score is higher for smaller class sizes.

For classes with less than 26 pupils, the dummy $D$ switches to one such that the estimated average test score in classes with less than 26 pupils is $334.60 + 72.40 = 407$. <br> This indicates that test score is higher for smaller class sizes. <br> Good Job!"
