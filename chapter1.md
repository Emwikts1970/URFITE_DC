## R as a calculator I

***=instructions

- Use R as a calculator. Calculate $3+4$, $6−8$, $3\times 5$ and $\frac{10}{3}$
- Save the result of $\frac{10}{3}$ to a variable, e.g. `x`, by using the `<-` operator: `x <- 10/3`
- Print the content of this object to the console by typing its name and pressing <i>enter</i>
- Round the result to 2 decimal places using `round(x, 2)`

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4, 6 − 8, 3 * 5 and 10 / 3


# Save the result of 10 / 3 to some variable


# Print the content of the variable to the console


# Round the result to 2 decimal places


```

3+4
6-8
3*5
10/3

# Save the result of 10 / 3 to some variable
x <- 10/3

# Print the content of the variable to the console
x

# Round the result to 2 decimal places
round(x, 2)

## Load data from .csv files into R

In R, it is often fairly easy to import data. This exercise will teach you how to import .csv files. "csv" means "comma seperated values".

The data set *cps_ch3.csv* is a sample from the current population survey data base. We have uploaded it so you can use the following url as path:

*http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/cps_ch3.csv*

Notice that it is also possible to read data from Your hard disk (the general case). The path then only needs to be set accordingly i.e. it needs to point to file on your hard disk.

*** =instructions

- Load in the data set with the help of the function `read.table()`. Assign the result to the object `cps`. 
Your code should look something like: read.table("dataset_url"). 

It is important to use quotes here to make sure R interprets the url as as string – a sequence of characters – instead of an object.

- Print the data to the console: `my_data`

- Have a look at the first few observations using `head(my_data)`

*** =hint

See `?read.table` for further help.

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Read in the data set and assign it to my_data


# Print the data to the console


# Have a look at the first few observations


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Read in the data set and assign it to my_data
my_data <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/cps_ch3.csv")

# Print the data to the console
my_data

# Have a look at the first few observations using head(my_data)
head(my_data)
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_object("my_data")
test_output_contains("my_data")
test_function("head")
success_msg("The cool thing about this is: You can access the data from anywhere. Try it yourself: Copy, paste and execute Your call of `read.table()` to the console of the R version You have installed on Your computer!")
```

## Wait ... something's not right

The data set should look something like:

  <table>
      <tr>
        <th>a_sex</th>
        <th>year</th>
        <th>ahe_12</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1992</td>
        <td>1.830.968.857</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>1992</td>
        <td>1.636.428.452</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
<br>
Instead we have:

  <table>
      <tr>
        <th>V1</th>
      <tr>
        <td>1;1992;1.830.968.857</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1;1992;1.636.428.452</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
<br>

R did not recognise the first row as the table header and interpreted the variables `sex`, `year` and `ahe_12` to be a single variable. As a result, R established a new variable `V1` where each observation consists of the respective three values merged in a string.

*Convince Yourself: Type and execute* `head(my_data)`.

To circumvent this, You need to tell R that the first row of the table is the header providing variable names and how variables are seperated (here, `;` is used as the seperator. You can think of it as a vertical line seperating variables in a table). 

*** =instructions

- Load the data set again. Set `header=TRUE` to tell R that the first line contains variable names and set `sep=";"` for setting the field seprator to `;`. Override the object `my_data` from the previous exercise with the correct table. 

- Have a look at the first few observations again by executing `head(my_data)` to see the effect of the additional arguments.

*** =hint

For further information on functions `read.table` and `head()` use the help function `?` in conjunction with the functions name, e.g. `?head`.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
my_data <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/cps_ch3.csv")
```

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Check again that my_data consists of one variable V1
head(my_data)

# Load the data set again, this time using arguments sep and header


# Inspect the data sets' head again

```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Check again that my_data consists of one variable V1
head(my_data)

# Load the data set again, this time using arguments sep and header
my_data <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/cps_ch3.csv", header = TRUE, sep =";")

# Inspect the data sets' header again
head(my_data)
```

test_function("read.table", args=c("header","sep"))
test_object("my_data")
test_function("head", index=2)
test_output_contains("head(my_data)")
success_msg("Cool! The next exercise shows You how to read in data from .txt files :-)")

## Load data from .txt files into R

We have prepared another data set containing observations from the 1985 Current Population Survey, this time in a .txt file to be found at

*http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/CPS1985.txt*


*** =instructions

- Load the data set and store it to `cps1985`. Make sure to specify the correct field seperator and to set the first row as the table header.
- Convince Yourself that everything went right by inspecting the first few observations with a call of the function `head()`.

*** =hint
For further information on functions `read.table` and `head()` use the help function `?` in conjunction with the functions name, e.g. `?head`.

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Read in the data set


# Inspect the result using head()


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Load the data set from the CPS1985.txt file
cps1985 <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/CPS1985.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)

# Inspect the result using head()

## Data Handling I

In this exercise, you will learn how to use data that comes with R packages. We use the `CPSSWEducation` data set contained in the AER package.

*** =instructions
- Load the AER package using the `library()` function by executing `library(AER)`. Add the `CPSSWEducation` data set to the workspace with `data("CPSSWEducation")` 
- Get an overview over the data stored in `CPSSWEducation` with help of the `summary()` function. Type and execute `summary(CPSSWEducation)`. Notice that `summary()` is called on an object. In R, an object's name has to be given without quotation marks.
- `CPSSWEducation` is a `data.frame` object. For now, you can think of it as a matrix where variables are stored in named columns. You can select a specific variable using the `$` operator. Print observations for `education` using the command `CPSSWEducation$education` 
- Use the `attach(CPSSWEducation)` command to attach the data set to R's search path. You are now able to access variables stored in the dataset by simply giving their names. Have a try: Execute `education`!
- Now suppose you are interested in the relation between earnings and education. Use `plot(education, earnings)` to create a scatter plot of observations on these variables

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the AER package and add data to workspace


# Use the summary() function on the CPSSWEducation data set 


# Print observations of `education`.


# Attach the data set to R's search path


# Plot observations on education and earnings


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Load the AER package and add data to workspace
library(AER)
data("CPSSWEducation")

# Use the summary() function on the CPSSWEducation data set 
summary(object=CPSSWEducation)

# Print observations of `education`
CPSSWEducation$education

# Attach the data set to R's search path
attach(CPSSWEducation)

# Plot observations on education and earnings
plot(education, earnings)

## Data Handling II

In this exercise, you will learn some more tricks in data wrangling. We already loaded the `cps1985` dataset for you, it is now available in the environment of you R session.
`cps1985` contains a subset of observations from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html">Current Population Survey</a>.

cps1985 <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/CPS1985.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)
```

*** =instructions
- Get an overview over the data set. Check its dimensions using `dim()` and compute some descriptive statistics with `summary()`
- Print the first 100 observations of `wage` to the console using `[]`
- Store all variables contained in `cps1985` except for `union` in a new object named `cps1985new`

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Check dimensions and compute descriptive statistics
