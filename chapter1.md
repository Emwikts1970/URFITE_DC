## R as a calculator I

***=instructions

- Use R as a calculator. Calculate 3 + 4, 6 − 8, 3 × 5 and 10 / 3
- Save the result of 10 / 3 to a variable, e.g. `x`, by using the `<-` operator: `x <- 10/3`
- Print the content of this object to the console by typing its name and pressing <i>enter</i>
- Round the result to 2 decimal places using `round(x, 2)`

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Calculate 3 + 4, 6 − 8, 3 * 5 and 10 / 3


# Save the result of 10 / 3 to some variable


# Print the content of the variable to the console


# Round the result to 2 decimal places


```

*** =solution
```{r}

# Calculate 3 + 4, 6 − 8, 3 * 5 and 10 / 3
3+4
6-8
3*5
10/3

# Save the result of 10 / 3 to some variable
x <- 10/3

# Print the content of the variable to the console
x

# Round the result to 2 decimal places
round(x, 2)

```

            incorrect_msg = "Nope, `x` does not contain the result of 10/3")

test_output_contains("x", incorrect_msg = "Did you type `x` to the console?")

test_function("round", args=c("x","digits"))

## R as a calculator III

*** =instructions
- Vectors `x` and `y` from the previous exercise are available in the environment. Use `c()` to combine both vectors in a new one and store the result in, say `z`.
- Figure out the length of the new vector with `length(z)`.
- Access the 6^{th} element of the new Vector by typing `z[6]`
- Sum up the 2^{nd}, 6^{th} and 8^{th} element of the new vector.

```{r}
x <- seq(2,10,2)
y <- seq(12,20,2)
```

```{r}
# Use `c()` to combine both vectors in a new one and store the result in, say `z`
z <- c(x,y)

# Figure out the length of the new vector
length(z)

# Access the 6th element of the new Vector
z[6]

# Sum up the 2nd, 6th and 8th element of the new vector
sum(yz[c(2,6,8])

## Data Handling I

In this exercise, you will learn how to use data that comes with R packages. We use the `CPSSWEducation` data set contained in the AER package.

*** =instructions
- Load the AER package using the `library()` function by executing `library(AER)`. Add the `CPSSWEducation` data set to the workspace with `data("CPSSWEducation")` 
- Get an overview over the data stored in `CPSSWEducation` with help of the `summary()` function. Type and execute `summary(CPSSWEducation)`. Notice that `summary()` is called on an object. In R, an object's name has to be given without quotation marks.
- `CPSSWEducation` is a `data.frame` object. For now, you can think of it as a matrix where variables are stored in named columns. You can select a specific variable using the `$` operator. Print observations for `education` using the command `CPSSWEducation$education` 
- Use the `attach(CPSSWEducation)` command to attach the data set to R's search path. You are now able to access variables stored in the dataset by simply giving their names. Have a try: Execute `education`!
- Now suppose you are interested in the relation between earnings and education. Use `plot(education, earnings)` to create a scatter plot of observations on these variables

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Load the AER package and add data to workspace


# Use the summary() function on the CPSSWEducation data set 


# Print observations of `education`.


# Attach the data set to R's search path


# Plot observations on education and earnings


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Load the AER package and add data to workspace
library(AER)
data("CPSSWEducation")

# Use the summary() function on the CPSSWEducation data set 
summary(object=CPSSWEducation)

# Print observations of `education`
CPSSWEducation$education

# Attach the data set to R's search path
attach(CPSSWEducation)

# Plot observations on education and earnings
plot(education, earnings)

```

*** =sct

              not_called_msg = "You didn't call `summary()`!",
              incorrect_msg = "You did call `summary()` with the wrong argument, `object`!")

                    not_typed_msg = "You failed printing observations of `education`. There must be a typo! Look again at your Code!")

test_function("attach", args = "what",
              not_called_msg = "You didn't call `attach()`!",
              incorrect_msg = "You did call `attach()` with the wrong argument, `what`!")

test_function("plot", args = c("x","y"),
              not_called_msg = "You didn't call `plot()`!",
              incorrect_msg = "You did call `attach()` with the arguments, `x` and `y`!")

test_error()
success_msg("Great! In the next exercise, You will learn some basic data wrangling techniques.")

## Data Handling II

In this exercise, you will learn some more tricks in data wrangling. We already loaded the `cps1985` dataset for you, it is now available in the environment of you R session.
`cps1985` contains a subset of observations from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html">Current Population Survey</a>.   

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r}
cps1985 <- read.table("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1276/datasets/CPS1985.txt", sep=",", header=TRUE)
```

*** =instructions
- Get an overview over the data set. Check its dimensions using `dim()` and compute some descriptive statistics with `summary()`
- Print the first 100 observations of `wage` to the console using `[]`
- Store all variables contained in `cps1985` except for `union` in a new object named `cps1985new`

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Check dimensions and compute descriptive statistics


# Use the [] operators to print the first 100 observations of `wage` to the console


# Create a new object `cps1985new` containing all variables from `cps1985` except for `union`


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Check dimensions and compute descriptive statistics
dim(cps1985)
summary(cps1985)

# Use the [] operators to print the first 100 observations of `wage` to the console
cps1985[100,1]

# Create a new object `cps1985new` containing all variables from `cps1985` except for `union`
cps1985new <- cps1985[,-1]

```

test_function("summary", args = "object",
              not_called_msg = "You didn't call `summary()`!",
              incorrect_msg = "You did call `summary()` with the wrong argument, `object`!")

test_output_contains("cps1985[100,1]",
                         incorrect_msg = "Have you used `[100, 1]` to print the first 100 obs. from `wage` in `cps1985`?")
                         
test_object("cps1985new",
            undefined_msg = "You did not define an object named `cps1985new`!",
            incorrect_msg = "The data set does not look the way it is supposed to be... Maybe you did somethind wrong with the indexing?")

## Data Handling III

This exercise teaches You some tricks using selfgenerated data. 

*** =instructions

- Construct a 3x3 matrix `X` containing numbers from 1 to 9 rowwise using `matrix()`
- Create two arbitrary numeric column vectors of length three named `x` and `y` and join them columnwise using `cbind()`. Store the resulting 3x2 matrix in `Y`
- Compute the matrix product of `X` and `Y` using the `%*%` operator. Store the resulting 3x2 matrix in `A`
- Transpose `A` using `t()`

*** =sample_code
```{r}
# Construct a 3x3 matrix `X` containing numbers from 1 to 9 rowwise using `matrix()`


# Create two vectors `x` = (1 2 3)  and `y` = (4 5 6) and join them using `cbind()`. Store the result in `Y`


# Determine the matrix product of `X` and `Y`. Store the result in `A`


# Transpose `A`


```

*** =solution
```{r}
# Construct a 3x3 matrix `X` containing numbers from 1 to 9 rowwise using `matrix()`
X <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9), nrow=3, byrow=T)

# Create two vectors `x` = (1 2 3)  and `y` = (4 5 6) and join them using `cbind()`. Store the result in `Y`
x <- c(1,2,3)
y <- c(4,5,6)
Y <- cbind(x,y)

# Determine the matrix product of `X` and `Y`. Store the result in `A`
A <- X %*% Y
